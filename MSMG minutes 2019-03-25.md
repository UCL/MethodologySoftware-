**Attendees:, Debbie Ford, Ab Babiker, Louise Brown, Ella Marley-Zagar,
Kevin McGrath, Ian White, David Fisher (phoned in), James Carpenter**

**Apologies: Carlos Diaz Montana**

1.  No issues from last meeting

2.  Ella summarised her work on art2bin

    a.  Testing finished for Artbin,Art2bin and unifying , issues raised
        concerned NI option and superiority -- discussion for Ab and
        Ella

    b.  Ian said is nice work and deserves a stata article.

    c.  Art2bin to be pasted over artbin? Ab said needed to preserve
        Artbin, maybe call new version \_Artbin. Issues raised concerned
        NI option and superiority -- discussion for Ab and Ella. Louise
        asked how works as a user, Artbin not a package,

    d.  Art2bin called because 2 arms, Art is multi-arm

    e.  Artbin never publicised, been ART up to now

    f.  Deborah had used version before the release, not been updated
        version. Dates were wrong but Ella said she's corrected.

3.  Ella summarised her work with Andrew Copas on sample size for
    clustered RCTs with baseline data (bcss program )

    g.  A stata program called bcss has been written which produces
        static graphs, testing finished.

    h.  Kevin has completed an interactive R Shiny version,

    i.  Github page is waiting for final answers from Andrew and signal
        to go live

4.  Kevin summarised work on David's admetan program

    j.  Testing programs have been written which can be inserted into
        David's test script.

    k.  A Github repository has been created where versions of admetan
        are to be stored showing full version history and testing
        procedures,

5.  Ian explained the intended use of Github in helping us organise
    storage, testing, version control and release of our software

    l.  Ultimate aim affords a way of showing end users documentation
        and full transparency of our testing procedures.

    m.  Version control provides history of program development with
        previous versions available if users wanted to access them.

    n.  Ian stressed the need for us to work collaboratively in
        developing our software, for example a colleague testing another
        colleagues program during development and GitHub provides a
        modern framework we can all use. Some discussion round this
        regarding transparency and access for external users which
        requires further discussion.

    o.  James said he had written a book using Github and Louise said
        willing to test as an end-user.

    p.  Ella and Ian mentioned some success with the bccs repository but
        an issue to be resolved with a conflict error, and Kevin pointed
        out we are still in the learning phase and hoped colleagues
        would gradually become familiar with Github. He hoped to send a
        link to the minutes of this meeting as a markdown document in
        Github which people could edit\... He suggested a possible use
        of Github could be to act as a version control management system
        for the department documents if colleagues could be persuaded to
        write them as markdown documents. James suggested the SOPs could
        be suitable.

    q.  Deborah confused whether software dissemination best using SSC
        or Github, Ian mentioned still on SSC but with a link to the
        Github web--page showing the testing procedures.

6.  Ian asked for priorities

    r.  Ab mentioned ART , testing , and new features , also artbin

    s.  Nstage , testing similar to artbin, speed up by coding in mata,
        comparing similar R packages

    t.  Ian proposed development of the Network meta- analysis program

    u.  David mentioned admetan

    v.  Ian at some stage JOMO needed porting to stata, MMX ported to R

    w.  Misc. projects such as web page

    x.  Survey of UK CTU's showed Stata dominant programming package,
        while true in UK, Ian wondered if this was true internationally.

    y.  James mentioned SMCFCS as an example of a "mature" Stata and R
        package so useful as a proof of concept.

    z.  Deborah mentioned Matteo's software for NI margins work, Ian
        questioned whether this was mature enough though certainly the
        aim, James pointed out just the thing to satisfy the QQR.

    a.  Ab mentioned non-proportional hazard tests, combine with ART,
        Ian said could be horrible job, James said questionable
        scientific benefit, Ian mentioned bringing staff into the
        system, Patrick may have a test script?

    b.  Ian, some help needed on Network, Louise asked whether ART/
        Nstage being extended and mentioned EAST software, Ian thought
        not, though said they might not be as right as could be?

    c.  David asked if we could look at user base to gauge demand

7.  The group will meet in 3 months and it is hoped Carlos Diaz Montana
    from DMS will be able to attend
