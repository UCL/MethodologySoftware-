**Managing and storing our software**
=====================================

Drafted by IW, 19/12/2018

Revised by IW after discussion 20/12/2018.

Needs
-----

1.  4 levels of storage

    a.  Local: Working copy held by person currently working on it

    b.  Master: CTU copy

    c.  Internal release: all of CTU

    d.  External release: Public copy

2.  Independent testing should always happen before release (= promotion
    from b to c/d)

3.  Testing must be documented & stored.

4.  Each program should have a "lead developer" (or lead developers?)
    who would control its development. (Better term than "owner".)

5.  Version control

6.  Backup

7.  Store communicaton with users (bugs, clarifications, new features)

Provisionally agreed model: github
----------------------------------

CTU copy held in UCL github.

Individuals can check this out to their own filespace, and work on it;
owner makes changes / others propose changes.

Release would primarily be to SSC but could also be to CTU website
and/or to public area of UCL github.

Next steps
----------

We need to learn how to implement this plan in github. We'll start by
aiming to store 2 real projects (Ella's and Kevin's projects with Andrew
Copas) and one toy project in github. We need to

1.  Understand basic mechanics of creating repository & pushing it to
    github

2.  Understand how to make a github pull request

3.  Agree a suitable directory structure for programs, test
    specifications, test programs, test logs, etc.

Actions
-------

1.  David and Andrew to get github accounts

2.  Ian to get UCL github accounts for David and Andrew

3.  Kevin to create a toy github project

4.  Ella and Kevin to create github projects for their work with Andrew

5.  Freya to fix another meeting late Jan, including Tim and someone
    from DMS
